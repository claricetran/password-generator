# Password Generator

## Description

This website generates a randomized password based off of a series of prompts. In building this project, I was able demonstrate the usage of while loops, for loops, functions, forEach methods, and objects.

## Installation

The website can be found [here](https://claricetran.github.io/password-generator).

## Usage

After opening the site the user will find the following starting screen:

Then the user should click on the Generate Password button and answer a series of prompts.

The user will then be asked to input a number between 8 and 128.

The user will be instructed to answer OK or cancel to confirm a password criteria.

After each prompt, the user will get a confirmation prompt.
